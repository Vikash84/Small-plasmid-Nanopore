### Figures

The `figures` directory contains all figures (both main-text and supplementary) for the study.



### Plots

The `plots.Rmd` file contains the R code used to generate plots for the figures.



### Method

The `method.md` file contains the commands I ran to conduct the analysis.



### Scripts

The `scripts` directory contains Python scripts used in the analysis: `align_reads.py`, `assign_reads.py`, `get_depths.py`, `get_gc.py` and `depth_and_gc.py`. See the header in each script for more information on how it works, and see the `method.md` file for how I used these to produce the data in the study.



### Data

The `Table_S1.xlsx` file contains various stats at the run level, barcode level and replicon level. See the first worksheet in the file for a more detailed description of the content.
